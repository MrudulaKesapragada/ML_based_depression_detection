# Depression Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Machine learning offers an advanced approach to detecting depression by analyzing behavioral patterns, questionnaire responses, and other relevant data. Traditional methods rely on self-reported assessments and clinical evaluations, which can be subjective and time-consuming. ML automates and enhances this process, improving accuracy and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects patterns in user activity and responses.
- **Automated Assessments**: Uses ML models to provide quick and accurate evaluations.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces subjectivity compared to traditional methods.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Flask / Django (for Web Interface)**
- **Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)**
  
  ## 🔄 Step-by-Step Process
1. **Data Collection** – Gather behavioral data, questionnaire responses, and other relevant datasets.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, normalize, and handle missing values in the dataset.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extract key features from the data to improve model performance.  
4. **Model Selection** – Choose suitable ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks).  
5. **Model Training** – Train the selected model using labeled depression-related data.  
6. **Evaluation** – Test the model using metrics like accuracy, precision.  
7. **Deployment** – Integrate the trained model into a web or mobile application.  
8. **User Interaction** – Allow users to input data (e.g., questionnaire responses) for prediction.  
9. **Continuous Improvement** – Collect real-world feedback to retrain and refine the model.
