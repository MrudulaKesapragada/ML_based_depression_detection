# Depression Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Machine learning offers an advanced approach to detecting depression by analyzing behavioral patterns, questionnaire responses, and other relevant data. Traditional methods rely on self-reported assessments and clinical evaluations, which can be subjective and time-consuming. ML automates and enhances this process, improving accuracy and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects patterns in user activity and responses.
- **Automated Assessments**: Uses ML models to provide quick and accurate evaluations.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces subjectivity compared to traditional methods.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Flask / Django (for Web Interface)**
- **Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)**
